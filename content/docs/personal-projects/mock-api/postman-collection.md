Before start using this collection, an environment should be created for the Mock API and inside that the variable ```mock-api.url``` should be define with the host url where the service is installed. I this case was created an entry on the ```host``` file of the operating system where this collection is being used with domain ```mock-api.dvlp``` pointing to service to be easier to access the service from the local machine.
