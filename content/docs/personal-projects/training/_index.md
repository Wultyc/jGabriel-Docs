Here is where I put the projects I made during any courses or training not related with my academic and/or professional formation.

## About the content in this section
Does this section represents all I know about every technology?  
Absolutely not! This section is intended to maintain a registry of the training I made in various technologies in order to use as future reference and guide.

Please do not look at this like "This is all he knows." but instead "He knows about this topics and maybe more."
