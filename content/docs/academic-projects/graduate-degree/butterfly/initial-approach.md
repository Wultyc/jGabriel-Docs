The main objective of the Curricular Unit, Modeling and Programming project is the creation of a program in Java language following the rules of object-oriented programming, which helps the management of internship projects in the Systems Engineering Degree.
In order not to limit ourselves to the main objective, we were more demanding, and we thought of other objectives that were important for the project and that somehow differentiated it from other projects, such as:
- Login process, which allows all users to have an account registered in the program;
- The management of permissions for the different hierarchies of the program (student, advisor and supervisor);
- Use of an admin profile, for the management of features that did not fit in the other profiles.
