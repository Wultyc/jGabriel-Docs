## Project phases
This project was divided into two phases. A first, carried out during the period of Operational Research where the problem was presented and requested a solution that consisted of developing a mathematical model to solve the problem and implement it in Microsoft Excel with VBA and Solver.
In Systems Laboratories 3 the challenge was to implement this same mathematical model, but this time in AMPL and build an application in JAVA with the responsibility of maintaining the warehouse information, sending an optimization request to the AMPL op and modifying the registered information using the result obtained.
